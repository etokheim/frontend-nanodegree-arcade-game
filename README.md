#Frogger game
As part of Udacity's nanodegree on front-end developement, I made a frogger game - Please download and try it out! :)

## How to play
### Start the game:
You can play the game [here](https://etokheim.github.io/Udacity/09%20Classic%20Arcade%20Game%20Clone/03%20Project%20-%20Classic%20Arcade%20Game%20-%20Ladybug/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/) or download the project and play locally.

### Gameplay:
The gameplay is pretty simple:
	* Use the arrow keys or swipe the screen to move.
	* You score 10 points if you manage to cross the road and go all the way to the top!
	* If you are hit by an enemy you lose 5 points and are moved back to the starting point.
	* You have 20.0 seconds to score as much as possible, good luck!

## Download
